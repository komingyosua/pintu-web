# pintu-web

The app is built with Vite.js to transform our app into esmodules which will increase the performance of build process also this will significantly increase our app performance.


Run the app:

- npm i
- npm run dev


Future Improvements:

- Implement sort and search based on query params from API, This will increase app performance.
- Implement design system for the consistentcy design of the application.
- If available, we can integrate with websocket to get latest price without refreshing (Pub Sub)
- Implement of pagination (Infinite scroll)
- Since webpack 5 has no nodejs polyfill, we could add NodeResolver to vite to have advantages to use a node function.
- etc.
